# InstaUiAngular

Live demo session on Feb 06, 2024 as part of Free Bootcamp on Web Development.

During the 50 minute live demo, participants witnessed how to use angular framework to develop the same ui that was built previous day in the [Plain HTML and CSS project](https://github.com/progalaxyelabs/bootcamp-04feb2024-insta-ui)

This demo shows how to add functionality to the ui using typescript and fetch posts from [backend server](https://github.com/progalaxyelabs/bootcamp-04feb2024-insta-api) 

This is the final code as of end of the demo session at 7PM IST





This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.9.

## Development server

Run `npm install` first to get all the node packages.

If you do not have angular cli already installed, install angular cli globally. Refer [Angular CLI Installation](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local#install-the-angular-cli)

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
